# rAvR

rAvR is a augmented reality application for djs and patrons to experience a new layer of music experience.




## Inspiration

As a group of musicians, graphics designers and computer scientists, we have been seeking a way to experience music and music events with djs and performers in a new an innovative way.


## What it does



rAvR now allows musicians not only to be creative, musically but allows djs and musicians to curate an experience by allowing the fans to participate in the actual music creation. 

Djs can now play music and also create innovative ways to allow fans and patrons to participate in the music show by selecting tracks, play samples and interact with a dynamic environments.

## How we built it

During this project we used, Unity, Microsoft Hololens and C# to build the various elements in virtual environment. We used the  Maya, Blender, Cinema4d, aftereffects for the creation of the various graphics and animations in the enviroments. And we used ableton and fruityloops to edit and create music as well as gain inspiration for dj controls and effects.


## Challenges we ran into

The first challenge what considering what environment and device to build on. We initially wanted to build on a VR platform but quickly realized that using and AR setup would allow patrons and musicians to experience the music shows in realtime, in real life with added lay of experience.

Another challenge we ran into, was creating a networked solution for the hololenses. There was loose documentation for networking of the hololenses and so creating custom code to show all the objects in all the hololenses in real time, was quite challenging. 

In graphics, understanding how to create actionable content, while creating a interesting environment, ease of use and understandable actions was a challenge we had to over come.

- The main challenge with this project was handling the hololens platform and since I have never interacted with a Hololens device before it took me a while to learn the inputs and I wasnâ€™t able to figure out how to network two devices with each other, but I did get very close!


## Accomplishments that we're proud of

None of our team members had experience with the hololens before the hackathon started.  Our software engineeers are high school students, 16 and 14 years old.  

I am actually proud that I was able to figure out how to use the hololens and that I got extremely close to figuring out the networking aspect of it. The fact that I got really close is an accomplishment because I had figured out a lot in a minimal amount of time.

## What we learned

Spacial understanding.  Augmented Reality development hurdles including anchor points and user interaction with gameObjects in AR.  Optimization within Hololens.  Time management.

## What's next for rAvR

Graaphical optimaztion for various delivery outlets.  Refine the networking to allow a seemless mutliplayer experience.
